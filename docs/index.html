            This website was created as part of a group project for the 
            Datalogical Thinking course of the Master’s in Information Science:
            Digital Environments, Borås University. The basic idea of the project
            was to curate a dataset, design an algorithm based on the dataset
            and publish everything on GitHub.Besides the homepage,  the website
            consists of an Algorithm page (presenting the pseudocode for the algorithm), 
            a Dataset page (with a link to the data), and a People page (us!). 
            Hope you find the information here useful and hope we pass the assignment!
            From all of us,
            Björn, Emma, Mihai, Sofia

            Welcome to the house of algorithmic horrors! 
            (to be pronounced with the voice of Vincent Price)
          </p>
          <p>
            Tales of high adventure on the dark seas of datasets await the weary
            traveller who dares to step inside the chambers of this haunted mansion.
            The first chamber (aka homepage) tells only the beginning of the story 
            and offers glimpses of what awaits in the rest of the house. 
            The second chamber (aka the Algorithm page) takes you inside the maze 
            of the algorithm from which only the cunning escape!
            The third chamber (Dataset page) boils down a library to the most basic
            information in the format of a csv file.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those that dare enter the last chamber will have to face the final 
            Bosses: the evil masterminds that created this soulless house of ghosts! 
            (please insert in your mind the image of Scooby-Doo saying ghosts and 
            being scared).
