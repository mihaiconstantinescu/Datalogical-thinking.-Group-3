          <h2>The algorithm</h2>
          <p>
            The story of our algorithm begun with the search for a question 
            (or several) that could be asked and answered based on our dataset.
            As library-lovers, we chose to think of the needs and curiosities 
            of the persons using the library and ended up with these questions: 
            <ul>
                <li>	Does the dataset contain a specific book?</li>
                <li>	Does the dataset contain books by an author?</li>
                <li>	Is a certain book popular or not?</li>
                <li>	Which are the most popular books within a shelf?</li>
                <li>	Which are the top ten most popular shelves?</li>
               </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            The algorithm was design with modern library clients needs in mind; such as author search, book search as well as find new material to read based on popularity. We decided to put the limit for popularity at a value of 30, but it's an arbitrary number that could easily be changed. We used George Polya's method (Dale & Lewis, 2020) as a problem solving method, iteratively working through the decisions.</p>
