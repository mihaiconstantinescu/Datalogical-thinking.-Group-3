          <h2>How the data was generated/curated/cleaned </h2>
          <p>
            The dataset consists of a list of 54 books with copynumbers, author
            names, total loans, shelfcode, publisher, publishing
            year, and place of publication.
          </p>
                    
            <p>The
            dataset is based on how real data from library catalogues can look,
            where copy-number (usually called “exemplarnummer” in Swedish
            library context), publishing details, authors and book titles are
            always present if the cataloging has been done correctly. As the
            majority of our group members have a LIS background this data felt
            familiar to us and understanding how the data could be used in a
            real world context was natural. </p>
            <p>The data in this dataset has been
            made up. Therefore the authors, titles, loans etc are not
            corresponding to anything in real life. The copy-number is also
            shorter than one might find in real life but works in this context.
            The inclusion of the shelf-code might seem confusing to someone who
            has never worked in a library before but this is important
            information to have as someone who is in the library space and needs
            to find a book.
          </p>
          <p>We focused on adding values in all fields, removed content that was not needed and separated the authors first and lastnames into columns as to fit better with our psudeocode. </p>
