          <h2>So who did what?</h2>
          <p>
            While most of the work in this process was done collaboratively,
            each person had a special area that they were responsible for. We
            worked in iterations and met up every couple of days to check each
            others work and work together before continuing on the next section.

            Because none of us had previous experience related to the assignment, we chose areas randomly, where each person was responsible for making sure that tasks in their area was planned and executed. As previously mentioned, we have all worked on all parts of the assignment.
